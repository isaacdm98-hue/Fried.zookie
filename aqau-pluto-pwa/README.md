# Aqau Pluto

A single-file, offline-first astrology + tarot PWA. Computed natal charts
(planets, houses, aspects, elemental balance), deterministic element-first
readings, an educational **Learn** screen, and a tarot reference — all
on-device, no server, no API keys.

## Engine

Planet / Sun / Moon positions come from **astronomy-engine** (Don Cross,
**MIT licence**), validated against NOVAS / JPL Horizons to roughly
**1 arcsecond**. ASC / MC and Placidus / Whole / Equal house cusps are
analytic trigonometry. Tropical, ecliptic-of-date.

This release replaced the previous Schlyter-series engine. The corrections
are invisible at sign level but real at the degree level — most notably
**Pluto (was off ~28 arcmin)** and **Saturn (~11 arcmin)** are now
professional-grade. No ephemeris data files are required.

> Note on licensing: astronomy-engine is MIT, so it carries no copyleft
> obligations for a closed/commercial app. (Swiss Ephemeris, by contrast, is
> AGPL-or-paid — deliberately avoided here.)

## Deploy (Netlify Drop)

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag the **folder** containing `index.html` and `sw.js` onto the page.
3. You get a live HTTPS URL immediately.

A service worker needs HTTPS (or localhost). Netlify provides HTTPS, so the
PWA installs and runs offline once loaded.

## Offline / install

`sw.js` caches the app on first load, so it launches offline and can be added
to the home screen. On iOS Safari: **Share → Add to Home Screen**.

## Files

- `index.html` — the entire app (astronomy-engine, chart logic, data, and the
  p5 canvas UI, all inlined)
- `sw.js` — service worker for offline launch

## Not yet verified

The canvas rendering and touch interaction can't be tested headlessly. Please
confirm on device: chart accuracy, the Learn screen, the bold block-colour
wipe between sections, tap-to-magnify on the chart wheel, and offline install.
